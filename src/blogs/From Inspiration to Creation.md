Back in my very first semester at my university, I was filled with curiosity. I remember clearly: a third-semester student had built a timetable website, which was almost used by everyone in the university.

I thought to myself, “That’s the kind of impact I want to create when I reach my third semester.”


Fast forward a year—and guess what? **I actually did it**.  
Not a building a timetable app again but building something that students, including me, actually felt the need of.

So I built **FAST Notes Hub**, a platform for university where students can easily access notes and past papers. Apparently, there was no past papers app before and students were using github repos for viewing it.

What started as just an idea has now grown into something real, something my fellow students are actually using. Seeing my work help others is an incredible feeling as for now **2000+ students** are using it, and I’m genuinely proud—not just of the idea, but of following through and building it.  


This project taught me the most important lesson so far: **dreaming is easy, doing is hard—but it’s the doing that matters.**  


Now, with this milestone achieved, I’m setting my sights on an even more ambitious goal for my 5th semester. The journey of learning and creating never stops, and I’m excited to see where it leads next.
