Back in my very first semester at FAST, I was filled with curiosity. I remember clearly: a third-semester student had built a simple timetable website, and almost everyone in the university was using it. I thought to myself, “That’s the kind of impact I want to create when I reach my third semester.”


Fast forward a year—and guess what? I actually did it.  


I built **FAST Notes Hub**, a platform for university where students can easily access notes and past papers. What started as just an idea has now grown into something real, something my fellow students are actually using. Seeing my work help others is an incredible feeling, and I’m genuinely proud—not just of the idea, but of following through and building it.  


This project taught me the most important lesson so far: **dreaming is easy, doing is hard—but it’s the doing that matters.**  


Now, with this milestone achieved, I’m setting my sights on an even more ambitious goal for my 5th semester. The journey of learning and creating never stops, and I’m excited to see where it leads next.
